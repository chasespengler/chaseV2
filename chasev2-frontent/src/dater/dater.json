I wanted to build out a chess engine so I could build bots to play against, train using ML, and study unique chess lines. The entire engine is built using Python and the pygame module. Pygame is very user friendly, and I look forward to building another game using more of its functionality in the future such as its sprite features and potentially joystick as well.
